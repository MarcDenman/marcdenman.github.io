Hi, I'm Marc.

I am 24, currently building stuff as an Applications Developer at [Huish](http://huish.ac.uk). I also pretty much like all things geeky.

Originally from Taunton, Somerset, I graduated in 2011 from Aberystwyth University with a BSc in Computer Science and promptly back to Taunton where I have remained since. 

If you need me then you can email me: marc@marcdenman.co.uk
