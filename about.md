Hi, I'm Marc.

I am 24 and currently building things as an Applications Developer at [Huish](http://huish.ac.uk). I also like pretty much everything geeky.

Originally from Taunton, Somerset, I graduated in 2011 from Aberystwyth University with a BSc in Computer Science and promptly moved back to Taunton where I have remained since. 

If you need me then you can email me: marc@marcdenman.co.uk
